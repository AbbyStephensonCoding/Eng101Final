               Some may argue that self-driving cars are inefficient, dangerous, and time-consuming. 
               Self-driving cars use optimization techniques to analyze the world around them and find the best solution for the current situation.
               There is less of a danger posed by self-driving cars compared to the average human driver because autonomous vehicles are unable to become distracted, intoxicated, or frustrated unlike the human driver.
               In a world with all self-driving cars, the roads will be as optimized as possible and not need human signals which will make travel more efficient and simplify infrastructure.
