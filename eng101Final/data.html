            Self-Driving Cars boast a wide variety of AI features to make them as safe as possible. 
            They have lots of sensors that use computer vision to analyze the world around them and AI models to perform safe actions.
            The AI in autonomous vehicles have progressed significantly in the past few decades, going from navigating a chair filled room in 5 hours using Dijkstra's algorithm to navigating complex roads with numerous algorithms.
            Eventually, when all cars are fully autonomous, technologies such as traffic lights and stop signs will become obsolete.
